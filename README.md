An experiment with OpenGL, pthread, and stuff... in C!

## Features (or things)

1. A bare pixel display and threading system that you can improve.
2. Depends on lightweight GLFW3!
3. Future TODOs: Lua scripting ability, including the availability of basic primitives like Rectangle, Circle, and many more.

## Compiling

Unfortunately, my IDE (Eclipse) automatically generates the Makefile.

But, you just need to know that you'll need to link GLFW and GL, and use the `-pthread` flag.
